# Basic Data Structures

#Set-->a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, 
#mutable and has no duplicate elements.

#Sets can be created by using the built-in set() function with an iterable 
#object or a sequence by placing the sequence inside curly braces,
#separated by a ‘comma’.

#A set cannot have mutable elements like a list or dictionary, as it is mutable.  

# Python program to demonstrate Creation of Set in Python
 
# Creating a Set
set1 = set()
set2={} #Another way to create a set
print("Initial blank Set: ")

# Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values
# stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. 
# 
# Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’. Although it is not 
# necessary, it is more common to define a tuple by closing the sequence of 
# values in parentheses. This helps in understanding the Python tuples more easily.
